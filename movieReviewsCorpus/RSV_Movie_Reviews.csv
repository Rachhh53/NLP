RSV_Doc1_MinorityReport,"Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick’s science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg’s complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick’s 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author’s vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg’s most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick’s obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author’s ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick’s work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity’s evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg’s film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick’s vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker.Set in the near-future, Minority Report introduces the concept of Precrime, Washington D.C.’s exploration into a revolutionary form of law enforcement. Founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), Precrime utilizes the “gifts” of the Precogs, three clairvoyants who have given up their freedom to support the cause of detecting crimes before they occur. The Precogs’ foreseen visions are analyzed by the Precrime unit and verified by a council of judges; a positive mark is identified, and suddenly officers race to prevent a crime from taking place. Impending perpetrators are caught and then booked before ever committing an offense. When the film opens, there hasn’t been a murder in the District of Columbia for six years; the existence of Precrime alone virtually eliminates the consideration of murder, so only crimes of passion remain. Though dedicated to the ideology of Precrime, Anderton’s personal life is in shambles. Long ago, his young son disappeared at a public pool; now a divorcé, he whiffs neural drugs to escape the guilt and painful memories of his former life. On the job, however, he remains professional and composed. In the opening scenes, Justice Department representative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) enters the Precrime offices to audit the program for national expansion and meets Anderton, who jealously protects the system he helped build. Witwer’s insistence that a human component will ultimately threaten the countrywide growth of Precrime quickly proves true after the Precogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder. Anderton has no plans to kill anyone, nor does he recognize the foretold victim, someone named Leo Crow. But knowing the efficient and absolute manner in which Precrime officers detain their would-be perps, Anderton has no choice but to run and attempt to prove his innocence on the lam.Established within these first scenes are all the elements of a wrong-man thriller, drawn from the institution of Alfred Hitchcock’s cinema. Titles like The 39 Steps and Saboteur begin with the false charge of murder, the yarn unraveling as the protagonist does the impossible to prove their innocence. These are spellbinding stories that contain an immediate suspense given the nature of the plot. Spielberg takes every advantage of that, employing Hitchcockian tropes in the film’s high-tech setting. While following Anderton’s flight from justice, the director uses the chase to explore the film’s ultramodern environment, showcasing a range of technology and equipment, but never slowing his pace to artificially linger on the background details more than the immediate wrong-man scenario. Hitchcock did the same, making his environments entirely functional within their scenes, though distinctive in their selection. North by Northwest, for example, uses Mount Rushmore, an emblematic and immediately identifiable landmark for its rousing finale, the characters dodging bullets and hanging on for dear life by the edges of the monument’s massive sculpted faces. And yet, the heads of those former presidents are never more interesting than Cary Grant. Minority Report‘s screenplay, written by Scott Frank and Jon Coen, scatters an array of multihued characters into the futuristic milieu, the most diverse of them appropriately being John Anderton. Peter Stomare plays a vengeful doctor with a nasty cold; Tim Blake Nelson is the Precrime prison’s wheelchair-bound containment sentry; Daniel London as the clingy babysitter of the Precogs in their floating nutrient pool; Lois Smith is the pessimistic, sharp-witted mother of Precrime. Cruise, however, renders the performance of his career as Anderton. His intensity and dimensionality make the story not merely one of watching as special-effects instill marvel, but one fully grounded in the motivation of the character, the importance of the chase, the pain of his tragic background, and his pursuit of answers to a crucial mystery.When Anderton decides to flee, a series of events perfectly ingrained into the future world of the film build to a matchless chase sequence, compiling twenty or so of the most exhilarating minutes in all of cinema. Inside his magnetically propelled car which rides on automated tracks, Anderton speaks to Burgess in a frenzied attempt to determine why he would murder this man named Leo Crow. As Precrime takes control of Anderton’s vehicle remotely, he carhops on a vertical highway and eventually makes his way to the subway. Eye scanners that track oncoming passengers via retinal charting help Precrime officers meet Anderton on the platform at the next stop; on jetpacks they pursue him into an alleyway where, when cornered, Anderton attacks, zapping his former colleagues with their own “sick sticks.” After commandeering a jetpack for himself, he flies through an apartment complex, escaping into an industrial district. The chase ends in an automated car factory, amid mechanical parts flashing sparks and robot assembly lines busying themselves. The officers on Anderton’s tail wield energy force “concussion guns,” blasting boxes and each other without harming surfaces. Witwer arrives on scene and he and Anderton engage in fisticuffs. Our hero drops from a moving platform onto the assembly line, into the framework of an unfinished vehicle. Automaton arms install pieces of the vehicle around him, Anderton barely evading part after part during the car’s assembly. His pursuers watch from a distance as the vehicle comes together, their perpetrator nowhere to be seen, possibly crushed inside the car being built around him. The car moves off the factory line, its construction finished; then Anderton sits up in the driver’s seat, unharmed. In one motion from the assembly line to speeding away to freedom, Anderton’s escape is complete.Spielberg envisaged the car factory sequence from a concept originally envisioned by Hitchcock for North by Northwest. The Master of Suspense wanted Cary Grant’s character, Roger O. Thornhill, to find himself in a Detroit automobile factory. As Thornhill walked and talked with an informant, the audience would have witnessed a car in the background being built on the factory line through a single tracking shot. Alas, Hitchcock and his writer Ernest Lehman could not conceive a reason to place Thornhill in Detroit, so the proposal was scrapped. Spielberg adapted it for Minority Report, using a piece of unproduced film history to directly acknowledge his picture as an ode to Hitchcockian devices. Another Minority Report scene features Anderton escaping into the rain with an umbrella, a Precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), guiding him to freedom by forecasting every move he should make to elude his pursuers. As Precrime officers pursue him on a higher level, they look down to see a crowd of pedestrians all with umbrellas and Anderton, umbrella overhead, lost in the throng, the scene a direct parallel of one in Hitchcock’s Foreign Correspondent. But more than a particular scene or two, Minority Report borrows the raw cinematic essence of Hitchcock thrillers—the atmosphere of tension combined with a pitch of pure, joyful entertainment. The momentum, from the nonstop crescendo of thrills throughout to the very public and quickly resolved finale, mirrors that of films like North by Northwest and Saboteur, and a dozen other Hitchcock pictures. The tone is serious while also allowing for humor, and the suspense never loses its potency. Spielberg uses Hitchcockian bird’s eye camera angles, long zooms, and sets his story to a rousing score by John Williams worthy of Bernard Herrmann, without losing his own directorial flourishes. And he accomplishes all this without feeling derivative; indeed, moviegoers not intimately familiar with Hitchcock’s oeuvre will miss the reverence hidden in plain sight onscreen.What Spielberg does differently than Hitchcock is turn his central plot device, or MacGuffin, into a critical philosophical tool for the entire film, versus the frivolous and pointless item Hitchcock’s MacGuffin usually proves to be. Hitchcock used microfilm or diamonds or cold hard cash, whereas the MacGuffin in Minority Report proves to be the eponymous file saved in the Precog’s brain. The three Precogs (Agatha, Dashiell, and Arthur, named after three writers you may have heard of) work as a hive mind, but the most gifted of them, Agatha, occasionally sees something different than the other two. Agatha’s “minority report” suggests that the Precogs’ vision will not necessarily occur the way they have communally predicted. For the integrity of Precrime, Burgess ordered that these reports be destroyed, though a copy remains stored away in Agatha’s unconscious. When Anderton learns of this, he sets out to find his minority report, if one exists, and expose his probable innocence. But before ever approaching the futuristic megalopolis wherein Precrime and ultimately his innocence reside, he prepares himself. Knowing that no matter how stealthy he may be, retinal scanners will identify him before ever reaching the city, Anderton arranges for an eye transplant in the criminal underground. He enters The Sprawl, a dodgy part of town both dark and enclosed, where Spielberg mutates his thriller with a film noir interlude. Projected on the room’s dank wall is a scene from Samuel Fuller’s gritty noir classic The House of Bamboo (a scene which Spielberg later uses to mirror Witwer’s death), an homage that also nods to the noirish manner of these scenes. A mad doctor performs Anderton’s procedure, leaving his eyes bandaged for a mandatory 12-hour recovery, his only comfort being some rotten chow in the fridge should he get hungry. Shadows fill the room, ceiling fans keep the space active, and neurological drugs pass the time. In the scenes prior to and after this sequence, the film contains a blue-gray sheen. Frequent Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski over-lights the bright future, bleach-bypassing them in post-production to retain a metallic utopian polish. But in The Sprawl there is only darkness interrupted by high contrast lighting.Driven into hiding by state-of-the-art policing technologies, Anderton must leave The Sprawl when technology seeks him out. A patrol moves from building to building in search of their fugitive, dropping “spiders” to scout out and scan residents. These self-guided, metallic gizmos scurry into homes for mandatory retinal identification; however, Anderton’s eyes need more time to heal from his surgery. Opening them now could leave him blind, and so he submerges himself in ice water to block the spiders’ infra-red sight. The spiders move from room to room, as Spielberg shows us in a skillful overhead sequence, filmed using an amazing set piece with precise camera movements that capture the residents through broken light panels and shabby ceiling tiles. The robotic hunters locate Anderton, hearing the smallest sound, but they scan only the counterfeit identity he paid for. What absorbing ideas these are for a world of plausible ingenuity. Part of Minority Report’s appeal is reveling in the superior technologies; headhunting spiderbots and magnetic cars and retinal scanners take a foreground role, but production designer Alex McDowell (Fight Club) imparts every scene with something imaginative and new. While many of the wonders therein originated in Philip K. Dick’s body of work, the better part of the film’s futuristic gear was conceived by some of today’s top minds. In 1999, two years prior to filming, Spielberg arranged a conference between fifteen specialists from various scholarly branches to assist in devising a believable, relevant futureworld. Representatives from the fields of architecture, biomedical research, physics, transportation, and modern fiction gave their input and helped boost the environment of the film, lending the configuration behind the film’s distinctive look, while also conceiving those clever details that make the world a believable tomorrow.Spielberg renders the film’s technology through a seamless blend of computer-generated images and physical creations, being a filmmaker who knows how to craft the fantastical into reality. Be it dinosaurs, wondrous UFOs, or lost biblical artifacts, the director’s ability to make the impossible seem real is unmatched. As a result, Spielberg’s mise-en-scène feels credible, more so than comparable science-fiction settings. The futurist aspects of the film were designed to be integrated with contemporary architecture, as if the environment had been built upon again and again through generations of advancement. The practicality of this filmic world and its believable consumer products have such a tangible sense of possibility that modern scientists have begun building what movie special-effects wizards created for the film. 3-D holograms, with which Anderton views home videos of his wife and son, appeared on CNN during the 2008 presidential election. NEC Corporation unveiled a camera in Japan that detects age and sex, formatting nearby advertisements to fit the photographed audience, similar to the retinal scanners in the film. And a number of companies have used Minority Report as inspiration to make touch-screens (like the iPad) and gestural interfaces (Xbox’s Kinect) a reality, drawing from the scenes where Anderton disassembles the seemingly random images from the Precog vision by tossing them about a clear, free-floating computer console. And when Minority Report isn’t shaping our real-life world, its influence is felt on countless other films, including virtually every subsequent sci-fi effort—Michael Bay’s The Island, Marvel’s Iron Man, J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek, and the list goes on.The film’s technology is never included superfluously. Each piece makes a comment on the scene or the vast future envisioned within the film, fully embedding them into the moment organically, always in service of the story’s unrelenting momentum. Consider the intrusive advertising, compelled by retinal scanners that read Anderton’s identity and try to sell him everything from beer to cars, or chart when he gets on the subway. Reading the retina, they flash across the eye to capture an identity, logging the information, location, and patterns into a stored database. Shown as a security measure early in the film, the scanner turns into a dangerous trap when Anderton is a fugitive, as the police connect to the scanning database to help find their man. Although the presence of in-film advertisements undoubtedly served needed product placements (most prominently Lexus, Pepsi, and Gap) and therein financing for the $102 million dollar production, the film itself integrates the technology of advertising scans into the thriller scenario, and the presence of the scanners and ads shifts dramatically, transforming into an invasion of privacy and an obstacle Anderton must overcome. Empathizing with the wrong-man hero, the viewer now sees the scanner less as a device to follow shopping habits and more of a tool to retain order. And because of this, Anderton goes to the extreme of transplanting his eyes with that of a non-criminal to escape the scanners’ constant presence. In another of Minority Report influences on modern culture, the seemingly futurist 2002 film predicted the outgrowth of invasive ads in metropolitan centers such as Times Square or downtown Tokyo.Set aside the suspense of this extended sequence of events, if possible, and instead reflect on what each technological detail tells the audience about the world of Minority Report. The magnetic car suggests this future offers an environmentally friendly solution to transportation, but that the driver has no control over their vehicle should an emergency arise. The eye scanners alert police to dangerous persons on the subway, making one of the most typically dangerous forms of public transportation worry free. Indeed, these conveniences make life easier, but they also grant a near absolute authority to the nonlethal police. The jetpack, Spielberg’s nod to the escapist sci-fi serials of yesteryear, remains the most implausible piece of technology in the film; though Spielberg acknowledges as much when Anderton spins his teammate opponents out of control. The technology reveals the utopia of Minority Report to be a dystopia in disguise. In Blade Runner, another Philip K. Dick adaptation, director Ridley Scott made the decomposition of his future landscape apparent in every frame, the putrefaction of the setting undeniable. Spielberg, conversely, aligns the conditions with the story. In the opening scenes, the District of Columbia gleans from its perfection, its rightness and spectacle soon to be expanded across the country when Precime is approved for national expansion. When Anderton wields technology in his favor, Spielberg treats it as an extraordinary spectacle. But when the hunter becomes the hunted, every tool at his disposal twists into a dangerous villain, frightening and impossible to counteract. Only through Anderton’s desperate humanity can he fight it. A futurology such as Dick’s admires how beneficial technology can be but also weighs the inevitable dehumanizing downfalls.In the case of Precrime, the question of technology develops into one of Free Will versus Determinism within an entrenched timeline, and using said technology to breach that timeline. Beginning with the Precogs’ prediction that Anderton will commit murder, the indictment sets into motion a chain of events that inevitably leads Anderton to kill his predicted target. So the question remains, would Anderton have killed Leo Crow if the accusation was not made? This is the film’s philosophical paradox through which the McGuffin is rendered all-important; and while raised, the question can garner no correct response outside of creative guesswork. The critique of the would-be utopia is complete when Anderton rescues Agatha to find his minority report; he learns she is not a foreseeing wunderkind, but an accident resulting from her neurological drug-addicted mother, and a prisoner in her position. Atrophied and woozy from the sedatives the technicians keep her on to predict more fluently, Agatha is nearly broken, jaded by the present, and clumsily clinging to her rescuer. She informs Anderton that though he has no minority report, he has a choice; by knowing his future, he can thusly change it by force of will. The structure of Determinism is subject to the unpredictability of Free Will. Regardless of his lacking minority report, Anderton has the self-control not to kill Crow. This choice repeats itself in the finale when Anderton confronts Burgess, the architect of the film’s frame job. The Precogs predict Burgess will kill Anderton, but Burgess chooses differently. The utopian aspects of the future, as well as The Precogs that are all but deified by their followers for the violence they have prevented, are both proven façades within a defective future bent on maintaining an illusion of perfection. In true form for Philip K. Dick, but strangely pessimistic for director Steven Spielberg, the film portrays the crumbling of a utopia through its reliance on its advances. Even if the story ends well for Anderton and the freed Precognitives, the future is nonetheless a bleak one.Beyond the genius sewn into the fabric of its scenario, its thread reinforced by the intricacy of its setting, Spielberg composed Minority Report to be a fast-paced union of brains and virtuoso sequences. This is pure, deftly stylized cinema hurtling from one crisis to another with incredible speed and breadth and cunning. John Williams’ thrilling and playful score forms a pitch-perfect marriage with the breakneck proceedings, and the noirish storyline, wrapped inside its science-fiction framework, gives way to an uncommonly exciting motion picture of substantial characters and profoundly involving sci-fi applications. The visionary quality of Minority Report‘s cinematic world is matched solely by its endless influence on both film and real-world technology since its release. But most importantly, its influence never overwhelms the picture itself. Spielberg’s film is ingenious not only for the filmmaker’s countless moments of cinematic resourcefulness and aesthetic wonderment, but for how every fascinating bit of technology or invention suffused into the film has a direct implication on the forward-moving plot and its intensely feeling characters, and furthermore, how the plot expounds an underlying philosophical question. Deepening the kinetics of an adventure, Minority Report maintains the power of a dynamic, ceaselessly entertaining, cerebral series of ideas born in the limitless mind of Philip K. Dick. Indeed, few films have ever been so much all at once and done so with such sublime artistry."
RSV_Doc2_MinorityReport,"In the movie it’s the future (2054) and we now see Washington D.C. where a system known as pre-crime is born. Pre-Crime is a new law system where people known as pre-cognitive are used as machines which can foretell the future and predict a major crime. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, one of the best officers who bust the people who commit the pre-crimes. The system is perfect, flawless and it does the job… but what happens when the system turns on you? Now, accused of killing a man in thirty-six hours he doesn’t know, he is now on the run from his own task force and a Government official (Colin Farrell) who wants him at all costs.I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg’s works. So, it was no surprise I’d try and check this out as soon as possible. I became a little jaded by his latest work “A.I.” which was sub-par, gloomy, and very confusing. I had my doubts going into this, but as I suspected I was in for a good time. This has to be one of Spielberg’s best ever; we instantly begin to become dazzled as Spielberg leaves us in awe with an incredible world which seems to be a mix of futuristic landscapes and skyscrapers mixed with small town suburbia and old-fashioned houses. We also get an amazing view of the highways of the future as cars not only drive along the ground but up on the sides of building into the skies.The city is very overcome by computer -generated ads by fashion companies and commercials that know our names and offer us products non-stop. We’re also kept under monitor as our eyes are scanned and indexed before we enter anyplace from bathrooms to trains. We get this view of the new world which is beautiful yet still very dangerous. The cast is phenomenal as Tom Cruise is at his top as John Anderton. We believe he is in danger and never doubt his desperation. I always question Tom Cruise as an actor, but this movie has proven me wrong.We get excellent stunts performed by Cruise himself as he scrambles desperately throughout the movie attempting to cheat a system that is basically fail safe. Colin Farrell is also truly excellent as Danny Witwer, the suspicious government operative who questions the system’s accuracy and will stop at nothing to catch John. The two plays off each other very well in action scenes and truly have excellent chemistry as they throw dialogue back and forth to one another, challenging each other’s expertise. Max Von Sydow is a great compliment to this movie as Tom’s Mentor and often his confidant helping him to fight off the law.The movie makes itself out to be a man-on-the-run movie when truly it is an intricate Hitchcockian murder mystery with plot twists and turns at every corner that kept me on the edge of my seat. This movie is very reminiscent of the golden era of movies where a thriller truly relied on character emphasis and plot twists rather than cheap contrived plot devices. Spielberg pulls out all the stops and is at his prime in this as he gives us truly dramatic camera angles that only increase the movie’s element of suspense and atmosphere. Spielberg lets us know that he can do any type of movie as he mends this movie into a masterpiece of art and acting. Ah, I remain loyal to Mr. Spielberg and continue to follow his movies and bow to his skill as he honors the movies with this masterpiece."
RSV_Doc3_MinorityReport,"In the year 2054, at the Department of Precrime in Washington, D.C., Case 1108 is assigned to Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise). It’s a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in “red ball” situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion – since there’s no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event.This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy – and it’s on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog – the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha’s files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy – one in which Anderton himself is the murderer.In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It’s a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it’s just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated “Blade Runner” setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens – an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city.As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man’s piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It’s a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger’s sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg’s brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of “Minority Report,” which, for a Philip K. Dick adaptation, possesses quite the focus on thrills and destruction over satire and criticism. And indeed, while the story is superbly complex, twisting and turning with expert elusiveness (save for a generic verbal slip to give away the final culprit), the original ending is altered to avoid the bleak, hopeless tragedy most often found in Dick’s potent short stories."
RSV_Doc4_MinorityReport,"“Minority Report” is the most un-Spielberg film ever made by Steven Spielberg.There is plenty of heartbreak and sadness in Spielberg’s movies. Certainly fractured families are a central theme. He’s made movies about the Holocaust, D-Day and World War I trenches. The film he made right before this one was “A.I. Artificial Intelligence,” in which bereaved parents replace their dying son with a robot who’s been tricked into thinking he’s a real boy.And yet, there is an undercurrent of light and hopefulness in his oeuvre that I find (mostly) missing in “Minority Report,” though “A.I.” probably comes closest in its dystopian themes and dour mood.In both movies technology has led to seemingly amazing achievements to benefit society, but there’s an insidious bargain underneath that threatens to upend the balance. That’s not surprising since it was based on a short story by the immortal Philip K. Dick, whose fears about the future essentially created its own film genre, tech noir. It was adapted for the screen by John Cohen and Scott Frank.I remember liking the film when it came out but not being amazed as other critics were. One of the areas I still find it lacking is the sense of an entire world being built around star Tom Cruise. Instead, it seems like Spielberg and his team created just enough pieces to serve as a backdrop, and no more. He doesn’t paint in the corners.There are the automated cars that move both horizontally and vertically, but other than a chase scene where Cruise leaps from vehicle to vehicle, they’re not really explored as a (literally) transportive societal evolution. Things seem… pretty well the same as they are now. They even have The Gap, in a self-reflexive bit of product placement.Though maybe the sameness is a commentary in and of itself.Set in the year 2054, the film has been pointed to as being prescient in its depiction of coming technological upheaval. We obviously don’t have the ability to predict the future or record thoughts into a video stream, though VR headsets can do a pretty good job of putting you into a created reality. And the mind-altering drug people use in the film, neuroin, bears disturbing similarities to the opioid epidemic of today.All the newspapers and magazines automatically update with the latest headlines, which if you were in the news business in the early Aughts, the talk of “e-paper” being the format of the future was all the rage. Instead we turned to reading on hard, graceless, 4-inch screens.Most interesting is the ever-present eye scanners, taking a cool gadget that’s a staple of the spy and sci-fi genres and turning it into an intimating facet of a world where our movements are continuously tracked — ostensibly for consumerist purposes, but as we quickly see the government is piggybacking on the gaze.We don’t use “eye-D,” as it’s called in the movie, so ubiquitously or without consent. But think about how our online explorations are customized through cookies and trackable data. Everyone knows how they’ve searched for a product and then seen ads for similar wares plastering our web carousing. Or getting a report every month from Google Maps telling you exactly where you’ve been, and when.Most of us would be mortified to have our browser history made public. In the world of “Minority Report,” everything about us is on continual surveillance and display, up to and including the things we think about doing. Literally, people are arrested and punished for things they were about to do.The story is at its root a meditation on free will and predestination. Usually such tales are set against a theological backdrop — if God determines our path, how are we really free to choose?As a good Catholic boy growing up, I was instructed that thinking about committing an act is just a much a sin as actually doing it. This was taught as a way to forbid sinful thoughts, but as any pubescent soon realized, they’re as impossible to shut out as the old saw of “Don’t think about elephants.”I think it was George Carlin who observed that the majority of Catholics who lapsed figured out that if you were going to be punished equally for thinking about doing something, you might as well experience the fun of actually doing it.(“I’ll take glaring holes in catechism for $1,000, Alex.”)The film largely eschews religious issues, other than the decoration of some people considering the three “precogs” as deities unto themselves. They are children born of early neuroin users with psychic gifts, which used in conjunction can read people’s evil intents before even they themselves are aware of them.Of course, this also involves being imprisoned in a floating “milk bath” that heightens their powers, kept eternally pumped full of hallucinogens and fawned over by a quite possibly lecherous keeper, Wally (Daniel London).Agatha (Samantha Morton) is the “most gifted” of the three, twins Dashiell and Arthur basically serving as assist men to the true genius. The three are named after famous mystery writers, and were trained by Dr. Hineman (Lois Smith), now living out her days in lonesome regret.As is often the case in real life, the creative partner was outlasted and outmaneuvered by the business shark, in this case Max von Sydow as Lamar Burgess, who is now desperate to take the “PreCrime” experiment from Washington D.C. to a national stage. This means jumping through small hoops held by big people.Hence the arrival of the inquisitive mind of Danny Witwer, a wolf-like young assistant attorney general played by Colin Farrell in his breakout role in American films. He instantly focuses his attention on Chief John Anderton (Cruise), who is the heroic public face of PreCrime. John lost his own son in a bizarre abduction at a public swimming pool years earlier, tanking his marriage to Lara (Kathryn Morris) and turning him into a stealth neuroin user.In early scene, John goes jogging through the shady part of D.C., his real purpose to obtain a fix, which he uses to heighten his mood while watching (crude) holographic home movies of his lost kid. The blind dealer removes his glasses to reveal cavernous empty eye sockets, seemingly revealing his very brains, with the admonishment, “In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king!”Watching the movie again, this line heralds a lot of high-contrast photography by cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, including a plethora of shots where one of a character’s eyes are turned away or lost in shadow.For me, the faster the movie’s plot-stirring gets, the more I tend to lose interest as it gets into pure chase-chase mode. Neal McDonough plays Fletch, John’s former right-hand man now charged with leading the hunt for him. “Everybody runs” is their mantra, leading to some slick action scenes with flying power suits and “sick sticks,” glowing batons that instantly make their target retch.In one of the movie’s coolest but most inscrutable sequences, John goes to have his eyes swapped out in a black market procedure to fool the eye-D scans.Peter Stormare plays the bottom-bucket doctor, who blows snot all over his hand right before sucking out John’s eyeballs. In a riveting soliloquy, the not-good doctor reminds John — now addled by anesthesia — that the chief locked him away years ago for intentionally setting his patients on fire, and now back-alley eye jobs are the only medical work he can do.It revs up to a classic “I shall have my revenge” declaration:“For true enlightenment there is nothing like… well, let’s just say taking a shower while this large fellow with an attitude you couldn’t knock down with a hammer, that keeps whispering in your ear: ‘Oh Nancy, Oh Nancy.’ Now that was a lot of fun, thank you so very much John for putting me in there, thank you so very much for giving me an opportunity to get to know myself much better.”As near as I can figure, though, the doc never actually extracts any kind of revenge. He competently performs his job, at less than his usual rate, even. John has a nasty encounter with a putrid sandwich and spoiled milk placed in the fridge of his recovery flophouse, though they appear to be genuine accidents as he blindly reaches on the wrong shelf from where the fresh sustenance lies.As much as I enjoy Stormare’s effortless creepy presence and off-kilter line readings, this whole bit feels like a buildup to an important moment that never arrives. I believe the whole thing could be chopped down to quick montage and improve the pacing. Though this would maybe suck some of the life out of the subsequent house search by tiny “spiders,” disc-like robots with wire-thin appendages deployed by the PreCrime brutes to infiltrate and forcibly eye-D peopleHence Cruise’s green eyes become dark brown halfway through the movie. He keeps the old eyes in a plastic biggie to sneak back into the PreCrime HQ (no one thinking to lock out his profile, apparently) with the intent to have them put back one day, but comically loses one down a drain.Tim Blake Nelson turns up as Gideon, the wheelchair-deployed officiate of the PreCrime “prison” where reside people judged and sentenced without actually committing any dastardly acts. They lie forever dreaming in plastic tubes, wearing coma-inducing “halos” around their heads like fallen angels as Gideon plays them orgiastic organ music to calm their prematurely damned souls.As Nelson brings an innate disquieting anxiety to his roles, one instantly wonders if, like Wally, Gideon is supplanting his official duties with an occasional tug ‘n’ grope of his comelier charges.John himself is briefly sentenced to the halo prison, his long run finally ending due to the machinations of Burgess, who is using his protege as the sacrificial pawn to ensure PreCrime is cleared for a national rollout. Lara springs him… surprisingly easily, and many have wondered if the film’s entire last act is a big guffaw and everything we’ve seen is merely the imaginings of John, still trapped in his plastic prison on a never-ending high.This would, of course, be a mirror of the finale of Terry Gilliam’s “Brazil,” one of my all-time favorite films and a clear inheritor of Philip K. Dick’s prescient, precious paranoia. His cinematic children were legion, even without an official credit.And while I don’t think “Minority Report” is among the finest of the adaptations, it’s a film that has aged rather well in nearly a couple of clicks down the big highway. There was even a briefly lived TV series a few years ago that came and went without me (or anyone) much noticing.Things end on a (somewhat artificial) high note — Burgess slain by his own hand, PreCrime disbanded and the not-yet criminals released, Agatha and the twins relocated from their enforced isolation in the pool to a self-imposed one in a lonely cottage on a Scottish cliff or wherever, free to live in the now and not the future.John even caresses the swelling belly of Lara, their love reborn with another life and shot at parenthood. It seems that free will does reign, along with happy endings in Spielberg flicks — even if it takes two-plus hours of haunting parable to get there."
RSV_Doc5_MinorityReport,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is a busy film. It fills your eye and ear - and, even rarer, your mind. It speculates on the future and uses what it visualises to commentate on the present.Like its three ""pre-cogs"" - clairvoyant visionaries gifted with the power to foresee future events - it forewarns us of the shape of things to come - some of which are already here. The film's sheer timeliness is a great part of its importance.It's set in Washington DC, a metropolis whose murder rate has dropped to zero. Crimes are prevented before they can be committed - thanks to tapping into the pre-cogs' premonitions. But if the streets are safe, it's because the old watchword about the price of liberty being eternal vigilance has been given a sinister techno-twist. In Spielberg's futureworld, the price of liberty is eternal surveillance.For all its own impressive dystopian design and cyborg melodrama, a comparable film like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was light on the way the future is already impacting on the here and now.Minority Report, based on a brilliant extrapolation from Philip K Dick's SF novel, pulls together what we see happening already in a world where people have their identities ""stolen"", machines ""judge"" our entitlement to be believed or not, and incarceration is sanctioned on suspicion of what we may do, not what we have done.In A Clockwork Orange, Stanley Kubrick foresaw the day a Minister of the Interior would brainwash criminals into subservience to the state and justify it because ""it works"".Spielberg's movie is the new, improved version of the proto-police state. It begins with what, for this director, is an uncommon kind of overture: sex and violence.Tom Cruise, head of the Pre-Crime Unit, stands on a podium. Before him, like instruments in an orchestra, are screens whose subliminal images, sourced from the clairvoyant pre-cogs, illustrate a crime passionel about to be committed.Like a conductor, Cruise waves his cybergloved hands accelerando in a race against time to pick 'n' mix the visual clues to the scene of the crime-to-be. This sequence alone crosses a new frontier in high-tech cinema.The airborne SWAT team, descending vertically on individual jet-propelled backpacks, make their arrest just before the jealous husband puts the knife in. He's whipped off to eternal hibernation, standing upright, to save space in prison.This prologue demo sets the stripcartoon style and pace of a movie that uses brainpower, not bubbles, to carry its message. Cruise is a flawed hero. His own child was abducted years before.The ""home movies"" he watches in his lonely high-rise home - actually images of ex-wife and lost child who ""materialise"" in his living-room in 3D - have a poignant melancholy suggestive of the loss of other values once real and dear to its citizens.Cruise's loss of his son is what motivates him to fight crime. Not for the first time in a Spielberg film, the violated family echoes the director's own childhood trauma just as Cruise's uneasy relationship with his boss, a patriarchal eminence played by Max von Sydow, recalls the director's acknowledged breach with his own father. In Minority Report, I suspect, is buried a substantial private agenda.The Washington DC Pre-Crime Unit is due to go national. A man from the Justice Department (Colin Farrell) arrives. This exseminarian operates with Jesuitical thrust and parry. In a few seconds, Cruise's authority is under threat. Farrrell's character is motivated by pure power, and played by an actor who doesn't just enter the film; he invades it. His performance can look Cruise in the eye without flinching.The air of conspiracy thickens when Cruise suddenly dredges up a pre-cognitive projection of himself committing a murder. Since technology refuses to admit mistakes - a bittersweet endorsement of HAL 9000's presumptuousness in Kubrick's 2001 - Cruise goes on the run to track the glitch in the machine to source, and discover the ""minority report"" made by the pioneers of Pre-Crime, which may exonerate his predicted crime.Like most Philip K Dick plots, the dramatic peak of cinematic imagination flattens somewhat at this point, though never suppressing the vital functions of plot or Spielberg's vision of controlled "" freedom"" 50 years from now.Fleeing, Tom is bombarded by advertising posters that identify him by his retina and importune him by his name; his ""wanted"" photo in the daily newspaper moves and speaks; the obligatory car-chase turns extraordinary when the cars start running up the walls of skyscrapers on tracks like a trouser zip; and desperate remedies to avoid detection, like having his eyeballs replaced with someone else's, has its own jokey pay-off when an electronic sentinel at a branch of Gap greets him with, ""Good to see you again, Mr Fukuyama.""Amid the bleak, metallic tones of designer Alex McDowell's cityscape, Spielberg stages some virtuoso action.Cruise grapples with a cop whose jet-pack goes ballistic and whirls both of them into the air, up the walls, through the windows, into living-rooms and kitchens - where the hamburgers get a passing grilling from the jet's exhaust - and up through the roof. Cruise jousts with Farrell on a moving assembly line in a car factory, and gets built into the bodywork of a brand new auto.All through Minority Report, there are nods of homage to cine-masters such as Hitchcock, Kubrick and Bergman. The shaven-headed precog savant (Samantha Morton) whom Cruise abducts and takes with him, in his flight, resembles the all-wise Star Child who swims into our ken at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.More unexpectedly, the wise old woman (Lois Smith) who pioneered the Pre-Crime project and now tends interactive plants in her greenhouse - one of them takes a shine to Cruise - resembles a more sober version of the clairvoyant Madame Arcati in NoÎl Coward's Blithe Spirit. (Spielberg is a Coward fan.)Minority Report ends with a confrontation American-style, rather than with an open-end conundrum in the European movie-making mode. Spielberg maybe felt he'd bowed sufficiently to questioning man's destiny when he made AI: Artificial Intelligence as a dutiful act of homage to Kubrick.If less poetic than AI, Minority Report is much more confidently directed, with a firmer sense of its maker's own urge to entertain and stimulate rather than bemuse.But even with a happier than warranted ending, the film is not comfort food for liberals. What elevates it far above its origin and format is its timely arrival. It constructs a world where security has become the main threat to liberty and every person's privacy is open to inspection by the state. It's a thriller with a built-in alarm bell. See it for your entertainment; ignore it at your peril."
RSV_Doc6_MinorityReport,"Minority Report , directed by Steven Spielberg, screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, based on a short story by Philip K. DickMinority Report is the latest film directed by Steven Spielberg. In the year 2054 murder has been eliminated in Washington DC through the use of a team of psychics who infallibly foresee killings. The would-be murderers are apprehended before they commit their crimes and sent to cryogenic freezing units. When the leading figure in the “Pre-Crime Unit,” John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is named as the future killer of a man he does not know, he sets out to unravel the mystery, with his own police force hot on his trail. Anderton’s own son was abducted and presumably murdered some years before, an event that also shattered his marriage.Spielberg is one of the more gifted members of a generation of studio filmmakers whose output in general has been exceedingly poor and forgettable. He has the undoubted ability to narrate a drama effectively, to hold the spectator’s attention and to develop a theme. His themes, however, tend to revolve around the concerns of his generation of upper middle class Americans. It is surely notable that in a filmmaking career spanning thirty tumultuous years, Spielberg, whose personal wealth reportedly exceeds $2 billion, has not once weighed in tellingly on the state of American society.Minority Report, based on a 1956 short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, has intriguing and entertaining elements. No expense has been spared. The filmmakers have thought up all manner of ingenious devices, combining the retrograde and the futuristic, to create the world of 2054. However, as is nearly always the case in contemporary science fiction, the imagination has only been set to work on “things,” not relations between people, not social life.There are absurdities in Minority Report which reveal a great deal about the social assumptions and prejudices of its creators. The American society of half a century from now is presented as generally prosperous and content, insofar as one is able to determine, but crime and murder (and drug use) persist. Why? Is there no connection between poverty and violent behavior, or, more generally, between social reality and crime? The filmmakers are either adapting to themselves to the right-wing argument that crime is essentially causeless (rooted in Man’s fallen state) or, probably more to the point, indicating their lack of interest in its causes and a concern merely with the means of avoiding its consequences.The discovery that the psychics do not always agree, that there are suppressed “minority reports,” suggesting other possible outcomes, is the turning point in Spielberg’s film. The Pre-Crime Unit may, in fact, be seizing and incarcerating those who were never going to commit any offenses. Anderton finds out for himself the complex relationship between the apparently inevitable and the actual manner in which events play themselves out.One can only respond: thank heavens for small mercies. Steven Spielberg and company do not, in the end, come down on the side of preemptively locking up everyone who is a potential criminal. A great day for democracy indeed!It was apparently a close call, however. When Spielberg was first considering the film project, he told Time, he “‘had much more of a popcorn movie in mind until I began to think about the ramifications of arresting people without due process.’ The director says it was his friend Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian, who alerted him to the constitutional problems of Precrime. ‘She said, “This would be a wonderful thing,” recalls Spielberg, “but what about the Bill of Rights?”’”Spielberg and Goodwin are not the only ones who find the idea appealing. Critic David Edelstein in Slate writes: “The movie presents us with a classic totalitarian trade-off, upgraded by technology and the paranormal: Would you surrender a slew of civil liberties for a world without crime? Assuming that the right people were always jailed for the right reasons, I’d think about it long and hard.”The assumption of all the above, of course, is that the state is a disinterested body, guided by fundamentally honorable motives, whose only concern is the welfare of its citizens. The notion that the state might represent distinct social interests, that it might be in the business of repressing the population for distinct political purposes—these are entirely foreign concepts to Spielberg and friends, who are, after all, a generally satisfied lot.This is not to say that the film offers no critique of the future world, or by implication, the present one. Spielberg is not a fool, nor simply a propagandist for the existing state of things. (After all, Schindler’s List had its moments.) The sight of helmeted, black-outfitted police crashing through windows and ceilings to apprehend individuals whose only crime is harboring violent thoughts is menacing and ominous—as are the images of mechanical spiders, who detect human presence, invading and searching an apartment building. However, Minority Report is largely carried along by other concerns and social impulses.Corporate saturation of American life, aided by technology, has reached such a point in 2054 that electronic billboards recognize the consumer (by his or her eyes) and deliver a personalized message. (“Good afternoon, Mr. Yakamoto. How did you like that three-pack of tank tops you bought last time you were in?”) On Internetnews.com Pamela Parker comments: “Imagine getting splashed by an animated digital billboard advertising Aquafina. Or having an ad in the subway say, ‘[Your name here], you look like you could use a Guinness,’ just as you’re coming home after a bad day at work. At one point in the movie the Tom Cruise character, on the run, is confronted by an American Express ad that says, ‘It looks like you need an escape, and Blue can take you there.’... Identification of consumers happens via retinal scans, which are presumably matched with names in a global database.”This invasive commercialism is more a source of amusement in the film, however, than disgust or protest. In any event, Spielberg is critiquing what his film encourages. Minority Report practices “product placement” (the display of commercial brands in a film) at a high level, providing advertising for Lexus, Reebok, Nokia, The Gap, Guinness, American Express, Bulgari and Pepsi-Cola’s Aquafina, among others.This “product placement” does not come free of charge. Lexus reportedly paid $5 million for the privilege of having a futuristic version of one of its automobiles appear in Minority Report. Business Week reports that “as part of the deal, the auto maker also delivered a shiny new $62,000 Lexus SC 430 convertible to Spielberg.” The magazine continues: “Why would Lexus put all that money into helping Spielberg design a pair of cars that will never be sold? Explains [Lexus marketing vice-president Mike] Wells: ‘We wanted to show the world that Lexus as a brand will be standing tall in 50 years.’”And there is more: “Lexus wasn’t the only large advertiser to help Spielberg defray the costs of making his film, which is laden with special effects. Phonemaker Nokia spent an estimated $2 million to design the futuristic handsets that Cruise and others use in the film, according to sources. Nokia also is running print and TV commercials to promote the film and its new 9290 Communicator, a $599 phone released in May, 2002, that can send and receive images, sound, and video clips. In addition, Nokia is promoting Minority Report on its Web site, where users can see the phone it designed for the film.”What is one to say? How could a film produced with such a degree of collaboration between filmmakers and giant transnational corporations possibly be expected to provide a clear-sighted view of contemporary life? At a time, no less, when the pervasive criminality of the corporate boardroom, its looting of the American economy of trillions of dollars, has been exposed.Hollywood’s liberalsThe views of Spielberg and his associates on crime, the police and democratic rights are conditioned by their social circumstances and connections. The garden variety Hollywood liberal, rich and complacent, would prefer, all things considered and if it did not prove too much of an inconvenience (or threaten his stock portfolio or career prospects), to live in a world where universal brotherhood reigned supreme. He does not view “democracy,” however, in association with the right of the broad mass of the population to decent living standards and to be defended against the coercive power of the capitalist state. In fact, he never thinks of such a thing at all, as contemporary films make clear. On the contrary, under conditions of growing social inequality, the population at large is seen in a generally hostile manner, as a potential threat to his wealth and privileges.All this directs today’s studio filmmaker irresistibly toward the figure of the policeman, both because he is the defender of private property (and thus deeply fascinating on the conscious and unconscious levels to the wealthy) and because he can be made to represent, falsely, “blue-collar” America.Minority Report provides us with a policeman’s-eye view, filtered through layers of Hollywood liberal cotton-wadding, of the issue of the police-state.In that sense, the filmmakers’ decision in the end to come down against “pre-crime,” while not unimportant, hardly stands out as a compelling defense of basic democratic rights. One only has to read the ignorant and wrongheaded comments of co-screenwriter Scott Frank: “People can be against capital punishment until they lose a loved one. We can be completely civilized until the murder rate goes way up and we need to figure out how to bring in the troops. That’s how dictatorships get started; it’s always for the greater good.”Minority Report’s general ambience reminds one of the discussions that took place in the liberal media following September 11 about the advisability of applying torture to terrorist suspects. The various commentators mulled over the idea of torturing prisoners, rolled it around on their tongues, so to speak, and generally concluded that, while tempting, it was probably not such a good idea. That such a discussion even takes place, whatever the immediate conclusions drawn, tells one everything about the given social milieu.Planning for Minority Report began three years ago and filming in March 2001. In its own peculiar fashion, this provides further proof that the Bush administration’s indefinite detention of individuals charged with no crime, the policy of making “preemptive arrests,” was not merely a response to the terrorist attack on New York and Washington, but was something very much “in the air.” It is a response, when viewed historically, to the increasingly untenable social contradictions of American society and the straining of these contradictions against the traditional forms of bourgeois democracy.Much has been made in the media about the coincidence of Minority Report’s opening and the incarceration of Jose Padilla, the alleged “dirty bomb” conspirator. The government claims the right to “anticipatory self-defense,” a phrase worthy of Spielberg’s “Pre-Crime Unit.” The film director told the New York Times in June: “Right now, people are willing to give away a lot of their freedoms in order to feel safe. They’re willing to give the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. far-reaching powers to, as George W. Bush often says, root out those individuals who are a danger to our way of living. I am on the president’s side in this instance. I am willing to give up some of my personal freedoms in order to stop 9/11 from ever happening again. But the question is, Where do you draw the line? How much freedom are you willing to give up? That is what this movie is about.”Minority Report has to be seen in the context of the subservience and spinelessness of Hollywood liberalism, and American liberalism in general. Those who wonder out loud about the pros and cons of a police-state have already accepted such a regime in principle. The passionate defense of democratic rights, as we have noted more than once on the WSWS, finds fewer and fewer partisans within the upper echelons of American society."
RSV_Doc7_MinorityReport,"Once again this year we are graced with a futuristic sci-fi flick based on a short story by the visionary Philip Dick, this time in the form of “Minority Report”, which poses the intriguing hypothesis: What if we could see into the future and arrest people before they commit a murder, or any other crime for that matter? Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as “Pre-Cogs” who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are “set” to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this “perfect” system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let’s face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he’s innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie.Directed by Steven Spielberg, “Minority Report” reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg’s last futuristic foray, “A.I.”, a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski’s artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning – those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect.Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise’s energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha’s Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha – tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic (“Dune”, “Judge Dredd” and “The Exorcist”) steps in as Anderton’s superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protégé Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who evokes a dichotomy of emotion in his belief and/or disbelief of the Pre-Crime system. As should be no surprise in a Spielberg film, supporting performances all seem to rise to new levels of excellence. Steve Harris, best known as Eugene Young on “The Practice”, is intriguing as Jad, but let’s not miss Neal McDonough as Officer Fletcher. McDonough is a man who has the ability to exude futuristic creepy at the drop of a hat. And of course, nepotism rears its – in this case – pretty head in the form of Spielberg’s daughter Jessica Capshaw who is excellent as Evanna.Unfortunately, I have the same problem with “Minority Report” as with “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.” Deviation from the original Dick story leaves huge gaps in the plot which require implausible explanations in order to close out the film. And again, we are left with numerous unanswered questions created by these implausible plot leaps. Although artistically and technically masterful, ambitious and intriguing, “Minority Report” still leaves you looking for the Spielberg of old – where cute and not-so-cute dinosaurs rule the world, even cuter aliens steal our hearts and we can all believe in a joyful place called Never Never Land with the help of a just a little pixie dust and a happy thought."
RSV_Doc8_MinorityReport,"Set in the year 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report looks clammy and bleached-out. The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience déjà vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven?The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter.There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet what's alarming to us may not be quite so scary to Spielberg the corporate-honcho visionary, who simply presents this stuff as a fact of (future) life. His attitude is a wary bemusement.What really spooks him, as in A.I., is that it may no longer be possible to be truly human in such a cyberfuture. Anderton, in addition to his Precrime problems, is also aggrieved by the unsolved kidnapping six years ago of his son. He compulsively plays back holographic home movies of his boy and has a drug habit. All this is meant to humanize Anderton for us, but Tom Cruise doesn't really have much inner life as an actor, and so the effect is muddled. Anderton is supposed to be running away from himself, from his demons, but that's not what comes across. He's running to get away. Cruise has become such a movie-star icon that we're supposed to gasp in awe whenever he gets down and dirty and messes with his iconography. In what amounted to a ghastly piece of reverse narcissism in Vanilla Sky, he spent half the movie sporting a surgically distended face. (It's as if he were saying, ""Look how ugly I make myself and still you watch me."") In Minority Report, he's such a dynamo that he converts even the process of grieving into a form of aerobics. Cruise carries the movie, but I was relieved to turn to some of the other players, including Colin Farrell as Anderton's nemesis, and Samantha Morton as the most gifted of the Pre-cogs, for more evocative human shadings.Spielberg is still in his Kubrick mode in Minority Report, which is to say that, even more than in A.I., he has split himself off from the verve and emotional sympathy that characterize his best films. I respect his desire to challenge himself and go deeper and darker. It's just that most of what's dark about Minority Report is basically futuro film noir, and what's ""deep"" about it are the standard sci-fi tropes about the individual vs. society and what's real and what isn't, as well as the usual quasi-religious overtones about playing God. Ultimately, the film turns into a soporific anthem for the power to choose one's future, followed by a quick fadeout of family togetherness. Although he can't quite get himself to do it, Spielberg clearly wants to drop the sentimentality from his repertoire: That anthem strikes a hollow chord, and the family idealizations are one-note. Minority Report is, among other things, Spielberg's attempt to extirpate once and for all his inner E.T. Like Cruise, he desires to deface his own image, which is perhaps why this new movie specializes in shots of severed eyeballs -- it's practically a motif. The most visually dynamic director of his generation wants to know what it's like to fly blind. That's what most repels him -- and attracts him. He's virtuosic enough to keep Minority Report aloft, but he's not soaring."
RSV_Doc9_MinorityReport,"In Minority Report, a futuristic thriller set in 2054, murder has been eliminated in Washington DC thanks to a division of law enforcement known as Precrime. Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers.Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities.Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future.As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!""Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication to fighting crime, the movie resorts to plot devices so often seen in cop dramas: after the disappearance of his young son six years ago, John has lost himself in drugs and his job, thus resulting in his wife leaving him. His home movies of his son are equally uninspired. Saturated with sappy, artificial sentiment, they should come with a warning label: ""Caution: May cause unnecessary and uncontrollable vomiting.""I'll give it credit for one thing: visually, Minority Report is remarkably stunning and imaginative. Its depiction of the future is vivid, highly realized, and full of creative technology. The elegant computer systems are particularly cool, and a concussion gun that Cruise unleashes on his pursuers looks like one hell of a fun toy. And with the cold, metallic colors that dominate the movie, the scenery often conveys a mood that the actors, plot, and dialogue cannot--a mood that is perfectly fitting for a dystopian story with characters who dream of murder 24/7."
RSV_Doc10_MinorityReport,"What new hell is this? In the shallow, noisy and pretentious Minority Report , we have seen the future. It’s not pretty.There are two Steven Spielbergs. One is the cinematic historian who instructs, informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindler’s List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery, who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs, space ships, Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelgänger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally, a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody, violent, cold and preposterous, Minority Report is not one of them.Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects, Minority Report has a boring, one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ), it’s set in Washington, D.C., in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a “priori,” developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow, that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called “Pre-Cogs” who float around in a liquid wading pool wired, drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit, Anderton can download images of clues, suspects and crime scenes, then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes, flexed jaw and a buzz cut, he’s a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs.The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft, because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere, Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney General’s office who covets Anderton’s job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here, the movie turns from a whodunit into a who’ll-do-it as the flawed hero (he’s hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out, stretching the film’s playing time to two hours plus. Mr. Cruise, who barely survived Vanilla Sky , one of the worst movies ever made, bares his teeth and pecs in a variation of the same role he played in that fiasco-a man driven insane by a technological bad dream. Not much of a stretch there, and the techno-gibberish about “Pre-Cog echoes” and “prevision data bases,” spouted with a terminally pained expression from the ludicrous script by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, almost flattens him.Meanwhile, Mr. Spielberg pours on the gore. In one scene, the star has his eyeballs surgically removed because in the future, we are told, identity searches scan only eyes. (Gee, whatever happened to fingerprints?) Carrying around those Tom Cruise eyes in a plastic bag as a sentimental keepsake, he drops one retina through the cracks of a drain while the other one hangs by its bloody optical nerves. Not a movie for anyone considering corrective Lasik procedures, or even changing contact lenses. Also not a movie where acting counts. Samantha Morton, with a shaved head, has an out-of-body experience as the Pre-Cog who disagrees with the others (this is called a “minority report”). Tim Blake Nelson plays the fiend who contains all of the killers, rapists and psychos from the past in data pods. The marvelous Lois Smith, who steals her brief scenes with relish as a horticulturist who holds the secrets to the minority reports, is nutty as a pecan pie. But the characters aren’t human enough to be real, or metaphorical enough to be comic caricatures. In the end, they are all upstaged by the macabre effects, created by production designer Alex McDowell, that make the whole movie look as though it was staged inside a stainless-steel paint bucket.When in doubt, bring on the gimmicks. Mr. Spielberg complies, showing off the latest stunts, tricks and toys as distractions far more interesting than the movie itself. Futuristic subway riders reading digital newspapers in which the headlines change between stops. Cops flying through space between skyscrapers like Superman in magnetic-levitation cars. Angry trees that grab you like the nasty apple orchard in The Wizard of Oz , injecting a poison that can only be cured by a foul-tasting brewed tea. Animatronic spiders slithering through walls and floorboards to identify suspects by shining a light in their eyes. Loopily cinematic, Mr. Spielberg the practical joker even stages a chase scene in a Gap store.Some things never change. Niche filmmaking will obviously still plague us in 2054, and so will the serious, unsettling questions it raises but fails to answer. Why is it that the visions of the Pre-Cogs never extend beyond Washington, D.C.? How will the Orwellian effect of the new technology invade privacy and affect civil rights? If the Pre-Cogs see different images, how can you prove a crime is going to happen beyond a reasonable doubt? In the ideological confusion, the film loses its credibility and raises more legal, social and political questions than it can handle. Mr. Cruise gets lost in the stew like a carrot. He looks like hell and goes through hell to earn his millions, but in Minority Report he’s just a small black hole at the center of an even bigger black hole."
